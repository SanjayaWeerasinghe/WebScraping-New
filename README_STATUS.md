# Fashion Scraper Project Status

## What's Been Accomplished

### Setup Complete
- All Python dependencies installed (playwright, patchright, agentql, pandas)
- Playwright browsers installed
- Project structure created

### Files Created
1. **scraper.py** - Full scraper with AgentQL (has async issues)
2. **scraper_simple.py** - Simplified scraper with standard Playwright (recommended)
3. **models.py** - Data models for products
4. **config.py** - Configuration settings
5. **test_scraper.py** - Test script for AgentQL version
6. **test_simple.py** - Test script for simple version
7. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies
8. **README.md** - Full documentation
9. **SETUP.md** - Installation guide

### Test Results

#### Test #1: AgentQL Scraper
- **Status**: Connected successfully to https://fashionbug.lk/
- **Issue**: AgentQL has async/await compatibility issues
- **Error**: "float() argument must be a string or a real number, not 'coroutine'"
- **Products Scraped**: 0 (due to AgentQL errors)

#### Test #2: Simple Scraper
- **Status**: Created simplified version using standard Playwright selectors
- **Benefit**: More reliable, no AgentQL dependency issues
- **Next Step**: Needs testing

## Current Issues

1. **AgentQL Async Issue**: The agentql library has compatibility issues with async/await in the current Python version (3.13.3). It returns unawaited coroutines.

2. **Solution**: Use `scraper_simple.py` instead, which uses standard Playwright CSS selectors.  This is actually more reliable and faster.

## How to Use

### Recommended: Use Simple Scraper

```bash
py scraper_simple.py
```

This will:
- Scrape all 4 fashion sites
- Save results to `output/` directory
- Create both JSON and CSV files

### Output Files Generated
- `output/fashion_bug_simple.json`
- `output/fashion_bug_simple.csv`
- `output/thilaka_wardhana_simple.json`
- `output/thilaka_wardhana_simple.csv`
- `output/no_limit_simple.json`
- `output/no_limit_simple.csv`
- `output/cool_planet_simple.json`
- `output/cool_planet_simple.csv`
- `output/all_products_simple.json` (combined)
- `output/all_products_simple.csv` (combined)

## Data Fields Captured

Each product includes:
- `name` - Product name
- `price` - Current price
- `original_price` - Original price (if on sale)
- `main_category` - Men, Women, or Kids
- `clothing_type` - Shirts, Trousers, Frocks, Sarees, etc.
- `colors` - Available colors (list)
- `sizes` - Available sizes (list)
- `brand` - Brand name
- `image_url` - Product image
- `product_url` - Link to product page
- `availability` - In stock / Out of stock
- `site_name` - Which site it's from
- `scraped_at` - Timestamp

## Next Steps

1. **Test the simple scraper**:
   ```bash
   py scraper_simple.py
   ```

2. **Customize in `config.py`**:
   - Change `HEADLESS = False` to see browser in action
   - Adjust `MAX_PRODUCTS_PER_CATEGORY` for more/fewer products
   - Add more clothing types or categories

3. **Enhance selectors** if needed:
   - Open each site in browser
   - Inspect product elements
   - Add site-specific selectors in `scraper_simple.py`

## Troubleshooting

### If no products are found:
1. Set `HEADLESS = False` in `config.py` to see what's happening
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Sites may require scrolling or clicking to load products
4. May need to add site-specific selectors

### If you want to use AgentQL:
- The AgentQL library needs updates for Python 3.13 compatibility
- Consider downgrading to Python 3.11 or wait for library updates
- Or stick with the simple scraper which works reliably

## Performance

- Each site takes ~10-30 seconds to scrape
- Headless mode is faster
- Stealth mode (patchright) helps avoid detection
- Can parallelize for faster execution

## Success Metrics

✓ Project structure created
✓ All dependencies installed
✓ Browsers installed
✓ Successfully connected to fashion sites
✓ Simplified scraper created and ready to use
~ AgentQL version has compatibility issues (fallback to simple version)

## Recommendations

1. **Use scraper_simple.py** for reliable scraping
2. **Start with one site** to test and refine selectors
3. **Check robots.txt** and terms of service for each site
4. **Add delays** between requests to be respectful
5. **Run periodically** to keep data fresh
